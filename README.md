### How do I approach designing software?

- **New Design Skills:**
I feel that working on the 3D scene project has helped improve my skills in problem-solving and thoughtful design of modular functions, like renderObject() and the UCreateMesh functions. It taught me the importance of abstraction in software design, allowing for code reuse across different parts of the project without redundancy.

- **Design Process:**
My design process began with a conceptualization phase, where I outlined the objects needed for the scene and their relationships. I followed this with a planning phase, determining the order of implementation based on complexity and dependencies. Starting with simpler objects like the desk surface and puzzle toy provided a solid foundation, moving on to more complex geometries like the AA battery, ball, and charging adapter objects.

- **Future Application of Design Tactics:**
The tactics of starting with simple components to build up to more complex systems, and creating modular, reusable code can be applied to future work. While much of the code in my project is not as reusable as it could be, in future projects I can envision improved re-usability and more well-designed functions, like with future lighting in my scene.


### Program Development Approach

- **New Development Strategies:**
While developing the 3D scene, iterative development and testing were crucial. Utilizing built-in formulas for object creation and refining them through iterations helped in efficiently tackling complex geometries like cylinders and spheres.

- **Role of Iteration:**
Iteration helped in my development process, especially in refining the shapes and functionalities of objects within the scene. Early meshes of objects went through several iterations to incorporate normal and texture data through updated shaders.

- **Evolution of Development Approach:**
My approach evolved from a focus on manual calculations to improved calculations for smoother mesh creation. This made the project easier to manage and maintain.


### Impact of Computer Science on Goals

- **Educational Pathway:**
Computational graphics and visualizations have given me an improved understanding of 3D modeling, lighting, and camera control at a core level as well as the applications of matrices on 3D environments.

- **Professional Pathway:**
The skills developed through this project prepare me for roles in software development, especially the more graphics-intensive applications like scientific/medical research and simulations, where visual representations of data can be crucial for understanding complex tasks.
